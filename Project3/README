# Scientific Computing - Project 3: Heat Equation and Neural Networks from Scratch

This sub-repository contains the materials for "Paper 3" of the Scientific Computing course at the University of Milan, a project that contributed to our final grade of **30/30 with honors (cum laude)**. This work was completed in collaboration with Chiara Galimberti.

## Project Overview

This paper tackles two significant areas: the numerical solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and the fundamental implementation of Neural Networks.

### Exercise 1: Numerical Solution of the Heat Equation
**Abstract:** We investigate the homogeneous heat equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and an initial condition. Our goal is to numerically approximate its solution `u(x,t)`. We employ discretization methods such as **Crank-Nicolson (CNCS)** and **Forward-Time Central-Space (FTCS)**. The numerical solutions are then compared against each other, highlighting the importance of time step selection, and validated against the exact analytical solution to assess approximation accuracy.
**Key Competencies:** Numerical Analysis, Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), Finite Difference Methods, Stability Analysis, Convergence.

### Exercise 2: Neural Networks from Scratch
**Abstract:** This exercise focuses on implementing a neural network from its fundamental components without relying on high-level deep learning libraries. We explore the core mechanisms of forward and backward propagation (backpropagation) for classification or regression tasks. The discussion also touches upon challenges like local minima, and potential approaches such as adaptive learning rates, batch size optimization, momentum, and noise introduction to improve generalization and stability.
**Key Competencies:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Network Architecture, Backpropagation Algorithm, Optimization Techniques.
