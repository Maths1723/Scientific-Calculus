# Academic Projects in Numerical Analysis and Artificial Intelligence

This repository hosts a collection of six projects developed as part of the **Scientific Computing** course (Mathematical Sciences curriculum) at the **University of Milan (Universit√† degli Studi di Milano Statale)**. These projects were completed in collaboration with a fellow student and were awarded a final grade of **30/30 with honors (cum laude)**, reflecting the depth and correctness of the proposed solutions.

The primary objective of these projects was to explore and implement fundamental algorithms in both **Numerical Analysis** and **Artificial Intelligence (Neural Networks)**. A significant emphasis was placed on developing solutions from first principles to foster a profound understanding of the underlying theoretical concepts and practical implementations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three sub-repositories, each corresponding to an examination "Paper" and containing two specific exercises:

### 1. [Project 1: Analysis of Dynamical Systems and Numerical Simulations](link-to-subrepo-project1)
* **Content:** This paper explores [brief description of the 2 exercises in Project 1, e.g., "2D Random Walk problems and numerical quadrature methods"].
* **Key Competencies:** Numerical Analysis, Simulation, MATLAB.

### 2. [Project 2: Convergence of Numerical Methods for ODEs and Epidemiological Models](link-to-subrepo-project2)
* **Content:** This paper focuses on [brief description of the 2 exercises in Project 2, e.g., "the convergence of explicit Runge-Kutta methods for rapidly decaying ODE systems and their application to epidemiological (SIR) models"].
* **Key Competencies:** Numerical Analysis, ODE Solving, Mathematical Modeling.

### 3. [Project 3: Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations and Neural Networks from Scratch](link-to-subrepo-project3)
* **Content:** This paper addresses [brief description of the 2 exercises in Project 3, e.g., "the numerical solution of the heat equation using various methods and the from-scratch implementation of a neural network for classification/regression problems"].
* **Key Competencies:** Numerical Analysis, PDE, **Machine Learning, Neural Networks (from-scratch implementation), Python.**
